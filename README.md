# Wardrobe

## The realtime clientside playermodel system

Wardrobe is an addon for Garry's Mod which provides extended support for hotloading playermodels from the workshop. It allows any player to enter the URL of a workshop addon and become any model of that addon.

This eliminates the need of having playermodels installed on the server, which reduces loading times and also provides
users with an extra layer of control, being able to disable custom playermodels altogether, ignore specific players, addons or only see the models of their steam friends.
